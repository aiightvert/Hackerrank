**1. Input Data Reading:**

The first line of input contains two integers separated by space: features and rows.
features denotes the number of features in each data point.
rows denotes the number of data points.
The subsequent rows lines contain the feature values followed by the target value for each data point.

**2. Data Preparation:**

Initialize empty lists X and Y to store the feature vectors and target values respectively.
Iterate rows times to read each data point.
For each data point:
Read a line of input containing the feature values followed by the target value.
Extract the feature values and append them to the list X.
Extract the target value and append it to the list Y.

**3. Feature Engineering - Polynomial Features:**

Create an instance of PolynomialFeatures from scikit-learn with a polynomial degree of 3 (degree=3).
Transform the feature vectors X using PolynomialFeatures to generate polynomial features up to the specified degree.
Store the transformed feature vectors in poly_X.

**4. Model Training:**

Create an instance of LinearRegression model from scikit-learn.
Fit the model to the transformed feature vectors poly_X and target values Y. This trains the linear regression model to learn the relationship between the polynomial features and the target values.

**5. Prediction for New Data:**

Read an integer new_rows from input, representing the number of new data points to predict.
Initialize an empty list new_X to store the feature vectors of the new data points.
Iterate new_rows times to read feature values for each new data point.
For each new data point:
Read a line of input containing the feature values.
Extract the feature values and append them to the list new_X.
Transform the feature vectors of new data points using PolynomialFeatures to generate polynomial features up to degree 3.
Store the transformed feature vectors in poly_newX.

**6. Prediction and Output:**

Use the trained model to predict the target values for the new data points represented by poly_newX.
Print each predicted target value rounded to 2 decimal places.
That's the complete algorithm breakdown. This script essentially reads input data, trains a polynomial regression model, predicts new data points, and outputs the predictions.
